# Bank-Loan-Repayment-Prediction-Model-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model that predict the chances of a customer or borrower repaying or defaulting a loan using ML algorithm.  It involves Data cleaning, feature engineering and finally predicting the output.
Objective

This model is going to help any banking or financial institutions in following ways.

1. It analyse borrower behaviour and repayment patterns
2. Build predictive models for Loan repayment classification
3. Identify the key financial & demographic influence in repayment

Dataset :

We have 2 dataset, Dataset 1 .................., Dataset 2............

Workflow

1. Data Collection and cleaning
2.
